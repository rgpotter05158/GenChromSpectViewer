08012019    This is a small program capable of viewing, calibrating and integrating general spectral data (i.e. NMR, FTIR, chromatography, etc).  The program interfaces with the MatPlotLib api and uses the numpy, scipy, and pandas packages.  These packages need to be installed in order for the lean version of the program to work.  Currently, only x, y data is capable of being processed.  The text file toySpectrum.csv is included with the package for an example of acceptable format.Typically runing export as text or similar with your spectroscopy software will provide data in a readable format.  Be sure to remove any headers the software may have included.  Currently only one file can be loaded at a time.  Spectrum/Chromatagram can be integrated by choosing Integrate from the Analysis tab and checking the Integration Mode box after the integration module has been launched.  Integrals are defined by click, drag and release of the mouse across the peak of interest. Currently, the spectra must be baseline corrected prior to using the program.  Otherwise, negative areas will be calculated as negative and cancel out possitive areas of the defined integral region.  Integrals are calculated using an implementation of the trapezoid rule.  A drawTraps program from the integration library is called to illustrate the area of integration on the MatPlotLib canvas.
